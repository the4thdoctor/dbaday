Database administration is weird. The job is a strange combination of theory and practice, strictness and loose rules mixed together in a magic blend.

The DBA is probably one of the most obscure and one of the less appreciated roles within the IT organisations.

Hard working goes pretty unnoticed and DBA are perceived as [grumpy and not approachable](http://www.sqlskills.com/insidercontent/201204/20120416newsletter.pdf).

DBA's work happens behind the scenes, with no fanfares, often the carefully planned operations are on the weekends or in antisocial hours. The DBA strives to keep the business up running but nobody knows.

## Say thank you  to your DBA!

The 3rd of July 2020 is the Database Administrators Appreciation Day.

If the business data is safely stored, if the business data is secure and the operations run smoothly, it's because you've got an awesome database administrator.

Let's shout loud **Happy DBA Day!**

Suggestions for showing appreciation to your DBA.


* Cake & Ice cream
* Pizza
* Cards
* Gifts
* Words of gratitude
* Do not deploy that migration that will shut down the database forcing the DBA to work over the week end to bring it back
