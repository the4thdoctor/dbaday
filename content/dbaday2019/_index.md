The second annual DBAday happened the 5th July 2019.

The website was visited during the day by 482 users with a total of 454 new users.

The top 3 visiting nations are 454 (76 visitors), USA (62) and Italy (59).

This year the site performed worse than last year. I hope the next year the word will spread across the DBA around the world and we'll get
a better DBAday.
