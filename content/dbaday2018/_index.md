The very first DBAday happened the 6th July 2018.

The website was visited during the day by 1,419 users with a total of 1,390 new users.

The top 3 visiting nations are USA (791 visitors), UK (289) and India (92).

It seems the word is spreading and hopefully the next year there will be an even better DBAday.

Below there is the twitter moment with the twits tagged with #dbaday.
