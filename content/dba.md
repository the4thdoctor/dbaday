Being a database administrator is weird. The job is a strange combination of theory and practice, strictness and loose rules mix together in a magic blend.

The DBA is likely one of the most obscure and one of the less appreciated roles within the IT organisations.

Their efforts are pretty invisible and they are seen as grumpy and not approachable.

However Database administration's work happens behind the scenes, with no fanfares. Often the carefully planned operations happen during the weekends or in antisocial hours. They strive to keep the business up running but nobody knows.

## It's the DBA day, show your appreciation!

The 6th of July 2018 is the first Database Administrators Appreciation Day.

If the business data is safely stored, if the business data is secure and the operations run smoothly, it's because you've got an awesome database administrator.

Let's shout loud **Happy DBA Day!**

Suggestions for showing appreciation to your DBA.


* Cake & Ice cream
* Pizza
* Cards
* Gifts
* Words of gratitude
* Do not deploy that migration that will shut down the database forcing the DBA to work over the week end to bring it back
