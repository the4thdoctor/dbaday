# Database Administrators Appreciation Day 2022, 5th Annual



If your business data is safely stored?
Is your data security taken care?
Is your database running safe and sound?

This doesn't happen by magic but just because you've got an awesome **database administrator**.

Database administrators usually work behind the scenes, over the **weekends and antisocial hours** in order to look after the database which is at **the core of any business**.

The 1st July 2022 give the gift of recognition to your DBA.
