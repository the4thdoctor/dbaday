## Database Administrators Appreciation Day 2019

Is your business data safely stored?

Is your data security taken care?

Is your datatabase running safe and sound?

This doesn't happen by magic but just because you've got an awesome **database administrator**.

Database administrators usually work behind the scenes, over the **weekends and antisocial hours** in order to look after the database which is at **the core of any business**.

The 5th July 2019 give the gift of recognition to your DBA.
