# Database Administrators Appreciation Day 2021, 4th Annual

If your business data is safely stored?
Is your data security taken care?
Is your database running safe and sound?

This doesn't happen by magic but just because you've got an awesome **database administrator**.

Database administrators usually work behind the scenes, over the **weekends and antisocial hours** in order to look after the database which is at **the core of any business**.

The 2nd July 2021 give the gift of recognition to your DBA.
