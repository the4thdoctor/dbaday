# Database Administrators Appreciation Day 2018, 1st Annual
The very first DBAday happened the 6th July 2018.

The website was visited during the day by 1,419 users with a total of 1,390 new users.

The top 3 visiting nations are USA (791 visitors), UK (289) and India (92).

It seems the word is spreading and hopefully the next year there will be an even better DBAday.
