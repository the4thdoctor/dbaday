# Database Administrators Appreciation Day 2021, 4th Annual
The fourth annual DBAday happened the 2nd July 2021.

The website was visited during the day by 1,229 users with a total of 739 new users.

The top 3 visiting nations are India (330 visitors), USA (150) and UK (54).

This year the site performed worse than last year. We need more efforts to spread the word. 

Anyway see you to the next DBADay!
