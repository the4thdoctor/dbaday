#  DBA Appreciation Day 2023. 7th July, 6th Annual


Is your business data is safely stored?
Is your data security taken care?
Is your database running safe and sound?

This doesn't happen by magic but just because you've got an awesome **database administrator**.

Database administrators usually work behind the scenes, over the **weekends and antisocial hours** in order to look after the database which is at **the core of any business**.

The 7th July 2023 give the gift of recognition to your DBA.
