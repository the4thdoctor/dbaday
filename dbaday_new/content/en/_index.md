#  DBA Appreciation Day
## The DBA Appreciation Day is an annual event happening the first Friday of July

The DBA Day 2024 will be the 5th July 2024

* Is it your business data is safely stored?
* Is it your data security taken care?
* Is it your database running safe and sound?

This doesn't happen by magic but just because you've got an awesome **database administrator**.

Database administrators usually work behind the scenes, over the **weekends and antisocial hours** in order to look after the database which is at **the core of any business**.

The 5th July 2024 give the gift of recognition to your DBA.

You can find the DBADay along with other PostgreSQL related events on the [“PostgreSQL Event Calendar”](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=NTdhMGEwM2E0OTI1NzAwYTFiZGZlZWYyMGNiYjM0MTMzMGFhMzQzM2ViZTY3OGU5ZDVjZDM0ZjYwNWEyZmQ5MkBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).
