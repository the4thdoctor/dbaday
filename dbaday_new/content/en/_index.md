#  DBA Appreciation Day
## The DBA Appreciation Day is an annual event happening the first Friday of July

The DBA Day 2023 will be the 7th July 2023

* Is it your business data is safely stored?
* Is it your data security taken care?
* Is it your database running safe and sound?

This doesn't happen by magic but just because you've got an awesome **database administrator**.

Database administrators usually work behind the scenes, over the **weekends and antisocial hours** in order to look after the database which is at **the core of any business**.

The 7th July 2023 give the gift of recognition to your DBA.
